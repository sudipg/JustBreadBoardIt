An EE prototyping assistant for the Bread Board
To allow users to draw a circuit diagram and then get instructions of how to build the circuit in real life on a breadboard.
Motivation: those new to EE and breadboards might have some trouble figuring out the more complicated circuits :
Just let the software do the thinking for you! saves time!
- Target for now : working console interface with a visual output
- Eventual Target: fully functional GUI output and input

## To do ##
  * Add remove\_component functionality
  * Make console more xterm-like
  * Deal with case when a lot of components are added
  * Improve circuit visual repr
